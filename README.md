# Code Playground

## Overview:
A bank of code assignments and resources for people to use whilst learning Python.

## Guidance:
I have designed this code repo to be aimed at all levels from novice to advanced. To those whom have coded before and are comfortable with how to begin, please feel free to plough head first into the assignments using your prefered python version (2 or 3). Those who are new, its suggested to read through the below sections.

### Software:
For beginners its recommended using the website repl.it to develop your code. Although this is not a full Integratred Development Environment (IDE), it will get you started and suffice for most of the assignments I post. You can write and run the code so its able to be tested.

When you get more advanced, installing python can be very useful and dedicated IDE's such as Sypder are avaliable to help run and debug code.
Another alternative is to use a Raspberry Pi for development. This comes with python and can act as a nice platform for testing.

### Learning Resources:
Google is your friend.
Its once once stated to me by a programmer I have a deep respect for that it is impossible to code without the internet. As a programmer, you are in no way shape or form expected to remember all the commands. You are however expected to have a logical mindset that can derive how a problem should be solved, and then implement the solution. Although there are thousands of ways to complete each of the assignments given, you need to think to yourself, 'How can I do this in the most efficient way possible?'. If that involves google or asking for advice, then so be it. Everyday is a school day.
Its therefore noted here that this repo is primarily based around you teaching yourself to solve the assignments. I have started basic and worked up providing what I believe to be the optimum solution to each, however you may do the same thing in a different way. Innovation and pioneering is encouraged. However in general, 5 lines are better than 50.

The best place to start is with the official docs at https://docs.python.org. When googling something, if this site comes up, use it.
Note: It doesnt matter at this stage if you are using python 2.x or python 3.x, just make sure you stick with whichever you choose throughout.
